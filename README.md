# Enterprise agent governance template

This template repository makes it easy for enterprise owners to get started with and establish settings for their agents by providing:
* The basic file structure necessary for custom agents
* An example agent profile in the `agents` directory
* An empty `managed-settings.json` file, which defines governance and extensibility settings in clients

> [!NOTE]
> The example agent profile is commented out, so you can use this template repository without unintentionally making a custom agent available to your team.

## Getting started

1. Using this template repository, create a private repository called `.github-private` in your organization.
1. Edit this README to best meet your needs. Consider including creation guidelines for custom agents or compliance considerations specific to your team.
1. Edit the provided `agents/example-agent.md` file to create your first custom agent. For more information, see [Creating custom agents](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-custom-agents).
1. Edit the `managed-settings.json` file at `.github/copilot/managed-settings.json` to configure enterprise-wide client settings. For more information, see [About enterprise-managed plugin standards](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-enterprise-plugin-standards) and [Disabling automatic command approval in Copilot clients](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-agents/disable-automatic-commands).
